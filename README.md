# Project 4
We made an app for employees to view their schedule and add new timings to their schedule.

## How to download
1. Open up which folder you'd like this repository to live in
2. Clone repository to your machine (this will download all of it)
```
git clone https://github.com/aetherxc/INCODE-3-project4.git
```

## Notes on CSS
Some values that I either learnt while putting this project together or that I believe are worth checking out for more dynamic css:
- custom properties and the general thinking that goes along with what should be a custom property/variable
- min(), max(), clamp()
- calc()
- absolute vertical centering

## Notes for students
This is intended as a guide only. Projects submitted using the same code won't pass.
